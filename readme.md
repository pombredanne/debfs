#DebFS#

Python based FUSE filesystem for mounting .deb files.

This is still a work in progress, so massive changes/refactoring will happen

 - Implementation of FUSE API's is incomplete
 - Intend to implement multimounting (similar to aufs)
 - Have the eventual goal of booting an entire debian install off of it.
